# Pacman-Search-Project

I completed a project in my Artifical Intelligence course (CMP 333) called Pacman search agent. These are all the searches it does: Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, A* Search. Finally i had to these questions Finding corners, Corner Problem Heuristic and Eating All The Dots. In the second project, i implemented the minimax and expectimax search that uses multiagents.
